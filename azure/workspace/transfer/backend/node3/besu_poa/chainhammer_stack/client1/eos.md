# eos benchmarking

## invitation
The github user `@eosclassicteam` has invited `chainhammer` to benchmark eosclassic, 
see [post 1](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-415486092) 
and [post 2](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/17447#issuecomment-415705182).

>  clique engine   
>  no dockerized/vagrant-virtualbox version  
>  improve existing consensus algorithm for public use  
> implement modified version of DPOS under ethereum environment

## on pause

1. They don't have a dockerized/virtualbox-vagrant setup yet, so I [suggested that in an issue](https://github.com/eosclassic/eosclassic/issues/19).  
1. As we [already have results for the  PoA algorithm Clique](geth.md), I am not going to benchmark EOS now  
  * but their second post reads as if they are also *planning to improve Clique* - then it might be worthwhile.

## you
Feel free to run chainhammer benchmarks yourself now - see [quickstart](README.md#quickstart).
